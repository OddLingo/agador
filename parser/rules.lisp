;;;; This file provides the rules for the Adjacency Parser to deal with
;;;; the toki pona language.  All rules are triplets.  The first two
;;;; terms, when found next to each other, "might" be acting as the
;;;; third term.  An optional fourth term is a function to run should
;;;; the third term end up spanning the entire input.

(in-package :AGP)
;;;; A 'routing table' of grammatical functions is derived from the
;;;; rules. It is a two-dimensional hash-table, first keyed by
;;;; the function of a 'current' node and then keyed by the function
;;;; of a 'goal' node.  The value at the intersection can be:
;;;; 1) Missing or NIL => do not proceed down this branch.
;;;; 2) T => This is the goal node
;;;; 3) AGP:LEFT => Take the left downward path
;;;; 4) AGP:RIGHT => Take the right downward path.
