# This file describes the rules for the Adjacency Parser to deal with
# the toki pona language.

# All rules are triplets.  The first two terms, when found next to
# each other, "might" be acting as the third term.  An optional
# fourth term is a function to run should the third term end up
# spanning the entire input.

# This grammar only mentions "nouns" but since most nouns in toki pona
# can also be adjectives, and most of those can also be verbs, we do
# not distinguish between them by word-type.  Instead we look at their
# position in the sentence.  Only the 'function words' are distinguished
# from each other.  The complete list of words is in file 'toki.words'.
